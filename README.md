# ðŸ§¬ Neuroevolution Flappy Bird

A neuroevolution-based Flappy Bird AI along with a website to present the biological and computational concepts for a bioengineering class at Cal Poly

- Created the Flappy Bird AI and game environment with JavaScript and HTML Canvas
- Used Tensorflow.js to design and train neural networks with genetic algorithms
